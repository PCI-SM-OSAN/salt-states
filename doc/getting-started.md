#Getting Started

## Helpful Reading
While not required, the following resources will help you get started on the technologies we'll be using and can be a useful reference in the future.

* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) - a Creative Commons book on Git, including installation, setup, usage, and internals. Specifically, sections 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 are good starting points. Section 2.2 goes over commiting changes. From there, use the table of contents to navigate to your item of interest. If you're going to use Salt, you need to be comfortable with Git.

* [A Successful Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). We will not be following this model *exactly* but our model will resemble this one.

* [Saltstack Walkthrough](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html) - A pragmatic guide for those new to Salt. Start here.

* [docs.saltstack.com](http://docs.saltstack.com) - We'll invariably start writing Salt States. Get to know this page. Specifically, the [list of modules](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/salt-modindex.html) and the [Table of Contents](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html). Those will be your starting points for future endeavors.

## How to Contribute
Specific branches cannot be protected in Github so we'll use another mechanism to keep the states pristine - Pull Requests.

In order to contribute to the repo, you will [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) it, make your changes, then file a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). This way, everyone can still contribute and no one has to bring in donuts because they pushed to Master.


## Finding Resources
So all you have a Windows laptop but you want to test some Salt states or try out a new package? Not to worry. There are plenty of cloud providers out there, but the recommended venue for ad-hoc VMs is [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). One small VM is $5/month. Even your grandma can afford that.
